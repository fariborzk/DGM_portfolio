# README for DGM HW4

## Project Overview

The **DGM HW4** project is focused on applying energy-based models (EBMs) and diffusion models to generative tasks, particularly for image generation. The project involves two main components: implementing an Energy-based Model (EBM) and understanding and experimenting with Diffusion Models.

### Part 1: Energy-based Models (EBMs)
The task involves implementing an EBM and understanding its principles, including learning energy functions for data distributions. The project provides hands-on experience with training EBMs and applying them to real-world generative tasks.

### Part 2: Diffusion Models
This part explores Diffusion Models, which involve gradually corrupting data with noise and then reversing the process to generate new data. The project involves understanding the denoising process, implementing it, and experimenting with image generation.

## Tasks and Tools
- Task 1: Implement an Energy-based Model (EBM) from scratch.
- Task 2: Experiment with Diffusion Models, focusing on the denoising process.
- Task 3: Use the models to generate images.
- Task 4: Visualize the generated outputs and analyze the effectiveness of both models.
