# README for DGM HW3

## Project Overview

The **DGM HW3** project focuses on applying advanced generative models to solve tasks related to image generation. Specifically, it involves two primary components: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Normalizing Flow models.

### Part 1: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
The task involves implementing a Deep Convolutional GAN (DC-GAN) model to generate synthetic images based on a given dataset, such as MNIST. The project also explores interpolation in the latent space, allowing for the generation of smooth transitions between different generated samples.

### Part 2: Normalizing Flow Models
This task explores Normalizing Flow models, which allow for learning complex data distributions. The goal is to implement a simple flow model from scratch and use it for image in-painting tasks. This part will help understand how these models can be utilized for generating realistic images.

## Tasks and Tools
- Task 1: Implement a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) using PyTorch.
- Task 2: Experiment with interpolation in the latent space.
- Task 3: Implement a simple Normalizing Flow model for image in-painting.
- Task 4: Evaluate the performance of the models and generate visual outputs.
