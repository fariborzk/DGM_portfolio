# README for DGM HW1

## Project Overview

The **DGM HW1** project focuses on the application of image processing and machine learning techniques to address challenges related to data generation, specifically in the context of image enhancement and generation. The project aims to explore different models and algorithms in the field of deep learning for generating synthetic data based on a given set of images.

In this task, the primary objective was to enhance and generate images using several deep learning models, including convolutional networks like PixelCNN and various modifications such as `Masked_Conv` and `PCNN_BlindSpot`. These models required careful preprocessing of images, training on large datasets, and evaluation of the results to assess their performance.

### Key Components
- Preprocessing and cleaning the input image data to prepare it for training.
- Building and training machine learning models to generate new images based on the dataset.
- Experimenting with different convolutional architectures to evaluate their effectiveness in image enhancement and generation tasks.
- Visualizing and interpreting the results to assess the performance of each model.

The models used in this project rely on advanced machine learning techniques and require substantial computational resources for training. The project also emphasizes the importance of evaluating the quality of synthetic images generated by these models.

## Tasks and Tools
- Task 1: Image Preprocessing using the `AR_ImageProcessing` technique for enhancing image quality and preparing the data for the subsequent models.
- Task 2: Development and training of a `PixelCNN` model.
- Task 3: Experimentation with different convolutional models such as `Masked_Conv`, `PCNN_BlindSpot`, and `PCNN_GatedConv`.
- Task 4: Evaluation of model performance using custom metrics. The results were visualized using several output files.
