# README for DGM HW2

## Project Overview

The **DGM HW2** project is focused on applying deep learning techniques, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to solve generative tasks in the domain of image generation. The assignment aims to implement and experiment with different architectures of VAEs, leveraging the power of neural networks to generate high-quality synthetic images.

### Key Components
- Implementing and training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating new images.
- Experimenting with different configurations and hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.
- Evaluating the quality of generated images through various techniques and metrics.

The project requires a solid understanding of both deep learning theory and practical implementation skills to build a working VAE model using Python and PyTorch.

## Tasks and Tools
- Task 1: Implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model using PyTorch.
- Task 2: Preprocessing and loading the dataset using the `torchvision` library.
- Task 3: Experimenting with different VAE architectures.
- Task 4: Visualizing generated images to assess the quality of the model's outputs.
